#1) Use R to figure out how many elements in the vector below are greater than 2 . (You need to filter out the NAs first)
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, NA, 1, 8, 3, 1, 4, NA, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, NA) #Create the rooms data objet
rooms<-na.omit(rooms) #clean data (i.e. remove NA's)

length(rooms[rooms > 2]) #Index the elements in 'rooms' which are larger than 2 and take the length of these elements.

#2) What is the result of running median() function on the above 'rooms' vector? (again, best remove the NAs)

median(rooms)

#The result is 1.5

#3) Inside your R Project (.Rproj), install the 'tidyverse' package and use 
#the download.file() and read_csv() function to read the SAFI_clean.csv dataset 
#into your R project as 'interviews' digital object (see instructions in 
#https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/setup.html and 'Starting with Data' 
#section). Take a screenshot of your RStudio interface showing a) the script you 
#used to create the object, b) the 'interviews' object in the Environment and 
#the c) structure of your R project in the bottom right Files pane. Save the screenshot 
#as an image and put it in your AUID_lastname_firstname repository inside our Github 
#organisation (github.com/Digital-Methods-HASS). Place here the URL leading to the screenshot 
#in your repository.
